Then I solved the second one by using the split method to get each ascii code then I decrypted it. |

I also documented and styled my code 
| Aug 28 | 5:30 - 6:00 pm  | I tried to solve the emoji puzzle. The first thing I noticed is that most of the emojis had points but I thought that was too unspecific. Next, I tried looking at unicode.  My approach centered on assuming the last character in the encrypted code was a period but I got nowwhere. |

Figured out caesar shift but I have to redo the overflow code |
